# Hey there human, alien, A.I, thing... 👋

# \* I’m a software engineer and rockstar, pilot(not yet) and farmer(not yet) :)

# \* I wrote my first line of code in 2016, while taking Harvard's CS50, and I've never looked back. I've written a bunch of languages so far, C, C#, Python, etc, but I have the most experience and love for Golang, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

# \* I've worked in diverse and distributed teams, where I made meaningful contributions as an independent contributor and a leader. Here's a link to my [resume](https://flowcv.com/resume/sjqt7ursjd) if you're curious about my work.

# \* Lately, I've been delving deep into distributed systems, sustainable energy, and farming.

# \* In my free time, I play vibe-chess on [chess.com/member/charlesonunze](https://www.chess.com/member/charlesonunze). When not strategizsing questionable moves, I'm either exploring new tunes on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/15qbklyo8uriy13n6dqny78j8), or immersing myself in the world of movies and the creative process behind various art forms.

# \* My most played song at the moment is [Conversation Piece](https://open.spotify.com/track/6qV3OEpN6uFCZnzNSslbn1?si=19a115c901f54f61) by Kings of Leon.

# \* And my favorite show at the moment is HBO's [Succession](https://www.hbo.com/succession).
