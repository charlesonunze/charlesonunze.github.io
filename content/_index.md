# Hey there human, alien, A.I, thing... ðŸ‘‹

# \* Iâ€™m a software engineer and wannabe music composer, pilot and farmer :)

# \* I wrote my first line of code in 2016, while taking Harvard's CS50, and I've never looked back. I've written a bunch of languages so far, C, C#, Python, etc, but I have the most experience and love for Golang, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

# \* I've worked in diverse and distributed teams, where I made meaningful contributions as an independent contributor and a leader. Here's a link to my [resume](https://flowcv.com/resume/sjqt7ursjd) if you're curious about my work.

# \* I've been recently obsessed with distributed systems and I've reading quite a lot about it and working on toy projects to better understand some concepts.

# \* I play terrible chess in my free time on [chess.com/member/charlesonunze](https://www.chess.com/member/charlesonunze) and when I'm not doing that I'm mostly looking for new music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/15qbklyo8uriy13n6dqny78j8) or watching a movie, or watching the creative process of a piece of art.

# \* My most played song at the moment is [Only The Strong](https://open.spotify.com/track/6c1LDkyXooBQWELWZlDwCt) by Laura Marling.

# \* And my favorite show at the moment is HBO's [Succession](https://www.hbo.com/succession).
